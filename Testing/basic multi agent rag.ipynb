With crispy edges, fudgy middles, and rich chocolate flavor, these homemade brownies will disappear in no time.\\nvegetarian — Jump to recipe\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor years, I couldn’t seem to find a recipe for brownies that met my standards. Anytime I made homemade brownies, I wanted them to be just like the ones I ate as a kid – super fudgy, moist, and chocolaty, with crispy edges and crackly tops. But the thing is, these brownies didn’t come from a recipe. We always made them from a box. Nowadays, I prefer to bake from scratch, but no brownie recipe I tried could live up to the chocolate brownies of my childhood.So this fall, as I flipped through Michelle Lopez’s new book Weeknight Baking, her recipe for Boxed Mix Brownies, From Scratch caught my eye. Would I finally be able to make homemade brownies that would be just as delicious as the ones from a box?The verdict: yes! I’ve had this brownie recipe on repeat since the first time I tried it. It calls for basic pantry ingredients, and it’s hardly more difficult than using a mix. As for the brownies, they’re true perfection – glossy, fudgy, and filled with rich chocolate flavor. Trust me, you’re going to want to make them ASAP!Another thing you should do ASAP is check out Weeknight Baking! This book is packed with crave-worthy recipes that are meant for busy weeknights. Each one comes with fun variations (I have my eye on the matcha snickerdoodles) as well as tips for becoming a more efficient baker. After years of juggling a 9-to-5 job and running her blog, Hummingbird High, Michelle is full of wisdom on how to bake on a busy schedule. She writes, “We’re all doing the best we can with what we have. And I’m going to help you bake any night of the week that works for you.” If you love baking, you’ll love this book.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHomemade Brownie Recipe IngredientsBack to Michelle’s recipe for brownies! In order for it to turn out like (aka better than) the boxed mix, Michelle uses granulated sugar, all-purpose flour, salt, and chocolate chips. Then, she adds these key ingredients:\\n2 eggs + water – Michelle uses a bit of water with the eggs to achieve the moist, gooey texture of boxed mix brownies without any commercial emulsifiers. And because this recipe doesn’t contain any baking powder, eggs are essential for helping the brownies puff up in the oven.\\nPowdered sugar – The trick to making homemade brownies that are just like ones from a box! Powdered sugar contains cornstarch, which helps thicken the batter without the chemical additives you’d find in a mix.\\nUnsweetened cocoa powder – Michelle recommends using Hershey’s Special Dark Dutch-processed cocoa powder (I used Whole Foods’ 365 Cocoa Powder). Make sure to sift it if it’s lumpy!\\nOil – While many recipes for brownies use unsalted butter, Michelle’s calls for canola oil, just like the boxed mix. I use olive oil because it’s what I keep on hand, and I love the rich flavor.\\nVanilla Extract – 1/2 teaspoon vanilla really amps up the chocolate flavor.That’s it! These fantastic homemade brownies are so easy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to Make Brownies from ScratchFirst, mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls.\\xa0Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext, combine the wet and dry ingredients. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, pour the batter into an 8×8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick – that’s ok.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, bake!\\xa0Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached. Allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing and serving. Enjoy!Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. They also freeze well for up to a month. Last time I made these, I doubled the recipe and stored the second batch in the freezer. It was so fun to have them on hand for a quick and easy dessert or afternoon treat!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBest Brownie Recipe Tips\\nBetter chocolate chips = better brownies.\\xa0In her book, Michelle writes that one of the biggest secrets to making great brownies is using large, good-quality chocolate chips. She recommends Ghiradelli’s 60% Cacao Bittersweet Baking Chips, while I love Enjoy Life’s Dark Chocolate Morsels. Either brand would fantastic in this recipe!\\nIt’s better to pull them out too early than to leave them in too long. No one likes dry brownies, so err on the side of caution when you’re making this recipe. Bake them until a toothpick inserted comes out with just a few crumbs attached. If you’re on the fence, go ahead and take them out of the oven. They’ll continue to firm up as they cool!\\nWait for them to cool.\\xa0Try your best to resist eating these guys straight out of the oven. Letting them cool makes them gooier and fudgier, and they’ll be less likely to crumble when you slice them. Plus, they’ll have an even richer chocolate flavor. Trust me, it’s worth the wait!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore Favorite DessertsIf you love this brownie recipe, try one of these yummy treats next!\\nPerfect Oatmeal Cookies\\nEasy Sugar Cookies\\nNo-Bake Cookies\\nBest Peanut Butter Cookies\\nOrange Zest Shortbread Cookies\\nVegan Coconut Macaroons\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet This Recipe In Your InboxShare your email, and we'll send it straight to your inbox.

They're fudgy, moist, and super chocolaty, with perfect crispy edges. From Weeknight Baking by Michelle Lopez.Equipment8x8 Baking Dish (this is the one I use so they don't overcook)Cooking Spray (I love this avocado oil one from Chosen Foods)Parchment Paper (this makes it so much easier to remove the brownies from the pan)Ingredients1 1/2 cups granulated sugar*3/4 cup all-purpose flour2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy1/2 cup dark chocolate chips3/4 teaspoons sea salt2 large eggs1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil**2 tablespoons water1/2 teaspoon vanillaCook ModePrevent your screen from going darkInstructionsPreheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!Notes*If you'd like to reduce the sugar, I've had success with 1 cup granulated sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups.\\n**I like to use olive oil because it's what I keep on hand and I enjoy the pairing of olive oil with chocolate. Keep in mind that you will taste it here. For a more neutral flavor, use canola oil.\\n***When these brownies come out of the oven, they'll be super gooey in the middle. Allow them to cool completely, about 2 hours, before you slice into them to give them a chance to set up. They'll continue to firm up the longer they're out of the oven. If you still prefer a firmer brownie, store them in the fridge.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDid you make the recipe?

But do the recipe actually make 16 brownies? Are they being cut very small?\\nReply ↓\\nAmelia\\n03.21.2025\\nSeriously the best\\nReply ↓\\nPhoebe Moore (L&L Recipe Developer)\\n03.21.2025So glad you loved them, Amelia!\\nReply ↓\\n\\nDebi\\n03.21.2025\\nOutstanding! I baked them for 45 minutes, first with pecans and then without. Both times, they were scrumptious, with a crackly top and goey middle. I used olive oil not extra virgin.  I will definitely keep this as my go-to recipe. Thanks so much!\\nReply ↓\\nCarole\\n03.20.2025I’m just putting a pan of these brownies in the oven and really excited to see how they turn out!\\nReply ↓\\nAshley\\n03.20.2025If, I wanted to add some protein powder to the receipe to increase the nutritional  value would that be advisable? I have PCOS and have to sneak extra protein in where I can. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\\nReply ↓\\nJeanine Donofrio\\n03.21.2025Hi Ashley, I haven’t tried protein powder in these so I’m not sure.\\nReply ↓\\n\\nAria\\n03.20.2025These came out delicious. The fudge was just right and  the texture was on point. Maybe for the people who left negative reviews, maybe you should ACTUALLY read the recipe\\nReply ↓\\nJeanine Donofrio\\n03.21.2025I’m glad you enjoyed them!\\nReply ↓\\n\\nMelinda\\n03.19.2025\\nI never write reviews, but felt compelled after seeing some negative reviews. Made these brownies yesterday (with canola oil) and they came out incredible! I did have to bake them 45 minutes, but they are crunchy on the edges and like fudge on the inside. Also waited the 2 hours before cutting them. Will make again!\\nReply ↓\\nJeanine Donofrio\\n03.21.2025Hi Melinda, I’m so glad you loved them!\\nReply ↓\\n\\nKarren\\n03.18.2025Can I use granulated whit sugar in the brownis instead?\\nReply ↓\\nJeanine Donofrio\\n03.18.2025yep!\\nReply ↓\\n\\nRaven\\n03.17.2025\\nFollowed the recipe to the letter – used extra virgin olive oil- used cups etc – my brownies were perfect 🙂 thank you – (experienced baker)\\nReply ↓\\nJeanine Donofrio\\n03.21.2025I’m happy to hear that!\\nReply ↓\\n\\nJason\\n03.17.2025\\nThis was a catastrophe. I have baked for 30 years. Test this recipe again. It does not set. Mine was liquid after baking. ( all ingredients measured on a scale. Temp verified with oven thermometer) let it rest on the counter overnight to see if it would firm up. Tipped the pan and poured, yes poured the brownies into the trash…. Very disappointed kids.\\nReply ↓\\nMadison\\n03.20.2025\\nSame here. I measured and followed exactly. I’ve been baking for over a decade 🙁\\nEven kept them in almost an hour longer. The edges baked, but not the center.\\nThe batter tested amazing.\\nReply ↓\\nJeanine Donofrio\\n03.21.2025Hi Madison, the center should still be a bit gooey – as we mentioned in the notes, they set up more as they cool.\\nReply ↓\\n\\n\\nMegan\\n03.16.2025I add espresso powder to my boxes brownie mix for better flavor. Would that be too much for these?\\nReply ↓\\nJeanine Donofrio\\n03.21.2025Hi Megan, I think it would be fine!\\nReply ↓\\nA food blog with fresh, zesty recipes.SEARCH RECIPES\\n\\n\\nbreakfast\\xa0\\xa0/\\xa0\\xa0main-dish\\xa0\\xa0/\\xa0\\xa0dessert\\nvegan\\xa0\\xa0/\\xa0\\xa0gluten freeALL RECIPES >>\\n\\n\\nHello, we're Jeanine and Jack.\\nWe love to eat, travel, cook, and eat some more!

My husband is active duty military and his birthday is today, however, he goes into the field today til Friday. I was so caught up with Thanksgiving I usually make him a cake(red velvet) with store bought mix but it completely slipped my mind. This recipe saved me last night! He had fluffy, delicious homemade white cake for breakfast 😂 I'm not sure why there's 1 star reviews because I'm no master chef/baker and it was easy to follow, tastes delicious. If you follow the directions exactly you'll have a nice, fluffy cake. You cannot just dump all the ingredients into a bowl and turn the electric mixer on. The batter was easy to mix by hand as he was asleep while I was baking. If it didn't work the first time try again it's not that serious lol. I will say I added a rough tbsp measurement of brown sugar and powdered sugar, added a tad more butter than the recipe called for, but other than that I followed right along with the recipe. Baked in a square brownie pan. Saving to my list! 5/5 stars! \\n\\n \\n04\\nof 663\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto by\\xa0\\nCrispMelon3412\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n09/20/2024\\n\\n\\n\\nWorth the effort\\nVery light, very great.

I made it in less than 10 minutes and baked it for 40 mins. It turned out amazing, served with blueberry jam and some fresh strawberries. Since it is simple bake its taste will surely highly depend on the quality of the ingredients. Use tasty starting materials. I creamed the egg and sugar thourougly. \\n\\n \\n06\\nof 663\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto by\\xa0\\nPerkyBao1282\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n04/13/2024\\n\\n\\n\\nEasy to follow\\n\\n\\n\\nWorth the effort\\n\\n\\n\\nCrowd-pleaser\\nThis is the third time I'm making this recipe.

This cake fits the bill! it has a wonderful flavor and texture. Not fragile, but not too dense. Stands up just fine with two layers. It is lovely with or without frosting! I decided to make a buttercream frosting with very subtle strawberry flavor and both the frosting and cake compliment each other very well. I would also imagine that this cake would be perfect to use for strawberry shortcake!Definitely a new keeper recipe for me!

They are singing a love song\\xa0to you: BAKE ME.\\nBAKE ME IN YOUR OVEN RIGHT NOW.\\n\\nIn This Post: Everything You Need For Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies\\n\\nVIDEO for How To Make The Best Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies\\nWhat Makes These Chocolate Chip Cookies The Best\\nChocolate Chip Cookies: Frequently Asked Questions\\nChocolate Chip Cookie Recipe Troubleshooting\\nFavorite Things To Make the Best Chocolate Chip Cookies\\n\\n\\nPrefer To Watch Instead Of Read?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Makes These Chocolate Chip Cookies The Best\\nSo where were we? I think we were about to count the number of cookies I’ve eaten as I’ve refined this recipe, which is\\xa0approximately\\xa0$&@^!# (censored).\\nI’ve always loved that old Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe, but I’ve always kind of been annoyed about it, too. Like why does it\\xa0need to melt only half of the butter? Does it really not work to melt ALL of it? And why does it need the\\xa0spoonful of brown sugar? Or does it? Sheesh, how annoying is the person who wrote that recipe anyway? *WOOPS*\\nNow for the good news!\\nI replicated the ULTRA THICK, ULTRA SOFT texture (it called for bold, right?) and maybe even improved the flavor with this version that is similar, but way easier and more sensible than the original.\\nAnd by sensible, I mean… just… like, lazy sensible, okay? I don’t mean THAT kind of sensible. You might\\xa0need to start\\xa0looking for another blog if you need your cookies to be sensible.\\nThere is nothing sensible about this beautiful sugar and butter perfection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow To Make The Best Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies\\nWhat I love about this recipe is that it’s so easy, and can become your “house chocolate chip cookie recipe” that you pull out on a whim, on a weeknight, that will make everyone around you happy.\\nHere’s the basics on how they come together:\\n\\nMelt Your Butter: No guessing on the right consistency of butter (room temp? cold? chilled?) – you’re just going to melt it all the way through in the microwave and let it cool for just a few minutes.\\nBeat Butter and Sugars: Get it nice and fluffy and creamy.\\nAdd Egg and Vanilla: Mix it just barely in (seriously, don’t beat that egg too hard!).\\nMix In Dry Ingredients: Flour, baking soda, salt, the usual suspects.\\nAdd Chocolate Chips: Duh!\\nBake Cookies: Roll ’em up into balls and bake – but please, please, do not overbake. We want them to be just barely done for that soft melty deliciousness.\\n\\nChocolate Chip Cookies: Frequently Asked Questions\\nWhy did my cookies flatten? The three most important things about this recipe are 1) Melting the butter, 2) Adding enough flour, and 3) Not baking for too long. If you find that the dough is wet and it REALLY sticks to your hands, you probably need more flour. I’ll usually add a few tablespoons at a time to get it to the right consistency. See the video in this post for reference as well as the cookie chart below!  Why are my cookies so puffy? This usually means that there’s too much flour in the dough, keeping them from spreading more. Be sure to always measure your flour correctly (spooning it in to the measuring cup vs. scooping from the bag). Since you can always add more, it’s important to not over-flour to start with. See the video in this post for reference on the correct consistency!  Can I freeze chocolate chip cookie dough? Yes! Roll them up into balls, freeze them on a sheet pan, and then keep them in a bag in the freezer until ready to bake. We’d recommend letting them thaw on a sheet pan (covered) before baking.  Can I make these gluten-free? We’ve never tried it with this recipe, but I’m sure you could! If you have a favorite 1:1 gluten-free flour, that’s probably your best bet. We’d love to hear how it goes.  How should I store the cookies after baking? The cookies can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for 3-4 days, or in the fridge for a week. We like the fridge method to keep them fresh! These are our personal favorite glass storage containers!*  Does this recipe work for high-altitude baking? Yes! Remember that when baking at a high altitude some baked goods will leaven and flatten more quickly. If you’re baking at 3,000+ ft elevation, we recommend increasing your oven temp to 375 degrees and reducing bake time by a few minutes. For more information on high-altitude baking, we love this resource.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFavorite Things To Make The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies\\n\\nParchment Paper\\nBuy Now → \\n\\nSquare Meal Prep Containers\\nBuy Now → \\n\\nStand Mixer\\nBuy Now → \\n\\nCookie Cooling Rack\\nBuy Now → \\nThe section contains affiliate links to products we know and love.\\n\\n\\nChocolate Chip Cookie Recipe Troubleshooting\\n\\nFrom our recipe tester:\\xa0If you’re running into issues with your cookies, you can reference the examples above to help find out what may have gone wrong. One of the keys to achieving the perfect cookie is to ensure the correct amount of flour is used.\\nIdeally, the flour should be weighed. We like a simple\\xa0digital kitchen scale* for ease.

No chilling required. Just ultra thick, soft, classic chocolate chip cookies!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIngredients\\n\\n\\n\\nUnits\\nUSM \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8 tablespoons of salted butter\\n1/2 cup white sugar (I like to use raw cane sugar with a coarser texture)\\n1/4 cup packed light brown sugar\\n1 teaspoon vanilla\\n1 egg\\n1 1/2 cups all purpose flour (6.75 ounces)\\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\\n1/4 teaspoon salt (but I always add a little extra)\\n3/4 cup chocolate chips (I use a combination of chocolate chips and chocolate chunks)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCook Mode\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPrevent your screen from going dark\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstructions\\n\\nVideo\\n\\nOn\\nOff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds to just barely melt it. It shouldn’t be hot – but it should be almost entirely in liquid form.\\nUsing a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars until creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just incorporated – 10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the egg for too long, the cookies will be stiff).\\nAdd the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your hands to press the crumbles together into a dough. It should form one large ball that is easy to handle (right at the stage between “wet” dough and “dry” dough). Add the chocolate chips and incorporate with your hands.\\nRoll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies) and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and just barely golden. Warning, friends: DO NOT OVERBAKE. This advice is probably written on every cookie recipe everywhere, but this is essential for keeping the cookies soft. Take them out even if they look like they’re not done yet (see picture in the post). They’ll be pale and puffy.\\nLet them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so (I mean, okay, eat four or five but then let the rest of them cool). They will sink down and turn into these dense, buttery, soft cookies that are the best in all the land. These should stay soft for many days if kept in an airtight container. I also like to freeze them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEquipment\\n\\nSpatula\\nBuy Now → \\n\\nNonstick Sheet Pan\\nBuy Now → \\n\\nMixing Bowl\\nBuy Now → \\nThe equipment section may contain affiliate links to products we know and love. \\n\\n\\nPrep Time: 10 minsCook Time: 10 minsCategory: DessertMethod: BakeCuisine: American \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nKeywords: chocolate chip cookies, best chocolate chip cookies, soft chocolate chip cookies, easy cookie recipe, small batch cookies\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDid you make this recipe?\\nTag\\xa0@pinchofyum\\xa0on Instagram so we can admire your masterpiece!\\xa0🌟\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Favorite Chocolate Recipes:\\n\\nDeep Dish Cookie Bowls For Two\\nPeanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookie Cheesecake Bars\\nThe Best Easy Peanut Butter Pie\\nSalted Caramel Brownies\\nBlackout Chocolate Cake\\n\\n\\nTime To Show You Off!\\nTag @pinchofyum on Instagram for a chance to be featured\\n\\n\\nOne More Thing!\\nThis recipe is part of our collection of easy dessert recipes.

I didn’t have eggs, so I used vinegar and baking soda as a substitute. Not sure if that had anything to do with the fact that the batter turned out very crumbly, but I added two tablespoons of milk to help it stay together. It still didn’t want to stick, but I made crumbly balls and cooked them anyway. When they came out, though, they were perfect! They did not spread much, but I like cookies that way. 😂 Thank you for this recipe! Very soft and delicious!

While it might make sense in a recipe where the butter simply adds a bit of smoothness to the recipe (pancakes, for example), but not where butter is the MAIN INGREDIENT. You need to qualities of butter which are, among other things, semisolid at room temperature. Try coconut oil for a healthier alternative to butter when making cookies. But keep in mind that coconut oil becomes liquid at around 70 degrees F, so those cookies might actually have a better texture when served cold. \\n \\n\\n12/29/15 @ 4:22 pm\\n\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nAeva \\nCoconut oil is actually much higher in saturated fat than butter is. Where butter is about 30%, coconut oil is about 60%. The claims that it is a healthy alternative seem to be grossly exaggerated, based on my research, so this might not be good advice from a health standpoint.\\n \\n\\n12/05/16 @ 12:44 am\\n\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nS \\nBut saturated fat is not bad for us.

However, coconut oil is high in natural saturated fats. Saturated fats not only increase the healthy cholesterol (known as HDL) in your body, but also help to convert the LDL “bad” cholesterol into good cholesterols. By Increasing the HDL’s in the body, it helps promote heart health, and lower the risk of heart disease. \\nSo…I don’t know what you are talking about. You sound uninformed to me. \\nAlso, I love butter. There’s nothing wrong with using either option it just comes down to what you want, how you feel, what you have available etc. I didn’t have eggs available and I had just enough apple sauce to make the recipe work so it’s technically vegan- I didn’t plan that out on purpose. I’m just too lazy to go to the grocery store today. Apple sauce has some good stuff about it and so does eggs. I’m not sure it really freaking matters which is healthier. \\nTHESE ARE COOKIES, MAH FRANDS!\\n\\n\\n\\n03/12/17 @ 8:41 pm\\n\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nNina \\nPlease don’t spread misleading information. I’m afraid you have been uninformed. Saturated fat in large amounts can actually contribute to increased serum LDL cholesterol levels.  It surely does not lower HDL. But we all deserve a treat from time to time so don’t be so hard on yourself and enjoy a good old fashioned chocolate chip cookie without the guilt. \\nSincerely,\\nA registered dietitian who loves to occasionally eat cookies the way they were intended to be made.

For this recipe, add 3/4 c. white granulated sugar and about 1 t. molasses, and you’ll have what the recipe calls for.  No need to combine them, just add as 2 separate ingredients.

Made with cocoa powder and chocolate chips, these homemade brownies are fudgy, gooey, super chocolaty, and easy to make!', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='For years, I couldn’t seem to find a recipe for brownies that met my standards. Anytime I made homemade brownies, I wanted them to be just like the ones I ate as a kid – super fudgy, moist, and chocolaty, with crispy edges and crackly tops. But the thing is, these brownies didn’t come from a recipe. We always made them from a box. Nowadays, I prefer to bake from scratch, but no brownie recipe I tried could live up to the chocolate brownies of my childhood.So this fall, as I flipped through Michelle Lopez’s new book Weeknight Baking, her recipe for Boxed Mix Brownies, From Scratch caught my eye. Would I finally be able to make homemade brownies that would be just as delicious as the ones from a box?The verdict: yes! I’ve had this brownie recipe on repeat since the first time I tried it. It calls for basic pantry ingredients, and it’s hardly more difficult than using a mix. As for the brownies, they’re true perfection – glossy, fudgy, and filled with rich chocolate flavor. Trust me, you’re going to want to make them ASAP!Another thing you should do ASAP is check out Weeknight Baking! This book is packed with crave-worthy recipes that are meant for busy weeknights. Each one comes with fun variations (I have my eye on the matcha snickerdoodles) as well as tips for becoming a more efficient baker. After years of juggling a 9-to-5 job and running her blog, Hummingbird High, Michelle is full of wisdom on how to bake on a busy schedule. She writes, “We’re all doing the best we can with what we have. And I’m going to help you bake any night of the week that works for you.” If you love baking, you’ll love this book.'),\n",

Made with cocoa powder and chocolate chips, these homemade brownies are fudgy, gooey, super chocolaty, and easy to make!', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='Homemade Brownie Recipe IngredientsBack to Michelle’s recipe for brownies! In order for it to turn out like (aka better than) the boxed mix, Michelle uses granulated sugar, all-purpose flour, salt, and chocolate chips. Then, she adds these key ingredients:\\n2 eggs + water – Michelle uses a bit of water with the eggs to achieve the moist, gooey texture of boxed mix brownies without any commercial emulsifiers. And because this recipe doesn’t contain any baking powder, eggs are essential for helping the brownies puff up in the oven.\\nPowdered sugar – The trick to making homemade brownies that are just like ones from a box! Powdered sugar contains cornstarch, which helps thicken the batter without the chemical additives you’d find in a mix.\\nUnsweetened cocoa powder – Michelle recommends using Hershey’s Special Dark Dutch-processed cocoa powder (I used Whole Foods’ 365 Cocoa Powder). Make sure to sift it if it’s lumpy!\\nOil – While many recipes for brownies use unsalted butter, Michelle’s calls for canola oil, just like the boxed mix. I use olive oil because it’s what I keep on hand, and I love the rich flavor.\\nVanilla Extract – 1/2 teaspoon vanilla really amps up the chocolate flavor.That’s it! These fantastic homemade brownies are so easy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to Make Brownies from ScratchFirst, mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls.\\xa0Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext, combine the wet and dry ingredients. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, pour the batter into an 8×8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick – that’s ok.'),\n",

It was so fun to have them on hand for a quick and easy dessert or afternoon treat!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBest Brownie Recipe Tips\\nBetter chocolate chips = better brownies.\\xa0In her book, Michelle writes that one of the biggest secrets to making great brownies is using large, good-quality chocolate chips. She recommends Ghiradelli’s 60% Cacao Bittersweet Baking Chips, while I love Enjoy Life’s Dark Chocolate Morsels. Either brand would fantastic in this recipe!\\nIt’s better to pull them out too early than to leave them in too long. No one likes dry brownies, so err on the side of caution when you’re making this recipe. Bake them until a toothpick inserted comes out with just a few crumbs attached. If you’re on the fence, go ahead and take them out of the oven. They’ll continue to firm up as they cool!\\nWait for them to cool.\\xa0Try your best to resist eating these guys straight out of the oven. Letting them cool makes them gooier and fudgier, and they’ll be less likely to crumble when you slice them. Plus, they’ll have an even richer chocolate flavor.

I baked them for 45 minutes, first with pecans and then without. Both times, they were scrumptious, with a crackly top and goey middle. I used olive oil not extra virgin.

My husband is active duty military and his birthday is today, however, he goes into the field today til Friday. I was so caught up with Thanksgiving I usually make him a cake(red velvet) with store bought mix but it completely slipped my mind. This recipe saved me last night! He had fluffy, delicious homemade white cake for breakfast 😂 I'm not sure why there's 1 star reviews because I'm no master chef/baker and it was easy to follow, tastes delicious. If you follow the directions exactly you'll have a nice, fluffy cake. You cannot just dump all the ingredients into a bowl and turn the electric mixer on. The batter was easy to mix by hand as he was asleep while I was baking. If it didn't work the first time try again it's not that serious lol. I will say I added a rough tbsp measurement of brown sugar and powdered sugar, added a tad more butter than the recipe called for, but other than that I followed right along with the recipe. Baked in a square brownie pan.

No chilling required. Just ultra thick, soft, classic chocolate chip cookies!', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='Chocolate Chip Cookies: Frequently Asked Questions\\nWhy did my cookies flatten? The three most important things about this recipe are 1) Melting the butter, 2) Adding enough flour, and 3) Not baking for too long. If you find that the dough is wet and it REALLY sticks to your hands, you probably need more flour. I’ll usually add a few tablespoons at a time to get it to the right consistency. See the video in this post for reference as well as the cookie chart below!  Why are my cookies so puffy? This usually means that there’s too much flour in the dough, keeping them from spreading more. Be sure to always measure your flour correctly (spooning it in to the measuring cup vs. scooping from the bag). Since you can always add more, it’s important to not over-flour to start with. See the video in this post for reference on the correct consistency!  Can I freeze chocolate chip cookie dough? Yes! Roll them up into balls, freeze them on a sheet pan, and then keep them in a bag in the freezer until ready to bake. We’d recommend letting them thaw on a sheet pan (covered) before baking.  Can I make these gluten-free? We’ve never tried it with this recipe, but I’m sure you could! If you have a favorite 1:1 gluten-free flour, that’s probably your best bet. We’d love to hear how it goes.  How should I store the cookies after baking? The cookies can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for 3-4 days, or in the fridge for a week. We like the fridge method to keep them fresh! These are our personal favorite glass storage containers!*  Does this recipe work for high-altitude baking? Yes! Remember that when baking at a high altitude some baked goods will leaven and flatten more quickly. If you’re baking at 3,000+ ft elevation, we recommend increasing your oven temp to 375 degrees and reducing bake time by a few minutes. For more information on high-altitude baking, we love this resource.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFavorite Things To Make The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies\\n\\nParchment Paper\\nBuy Now → \\n\\nSquare Meal Prep Containers\\nBuy Now →'),\n",

Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds to just barely melt it. It shouldn’t be hot – but it should be almost entirely in liquid form.\\nUsing a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars until creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just incorporated – 10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the egg for too long, the cookies will be stiff).\\nAdd the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your hands to press the crumbles together into a dough. It should form one large ball that is easy to handle (right at the stage between “wet” dough and “dry” dough). Add the chocolate chips and incorporate with your hands.\\nRoll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies) and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and just barely golden. Warning, friends: DO NOT OVERBAKE. This advice is probably written on every cookie recipe everywhere, but this is essential for keeping the cookies soft. Take them out even if they look like they’re not done yet (see picture in the post). They’ll be pale and puffy.\\nLet them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so (I mean, okay, eat four or five but then let the rest of them cool). They will sink down and turn into these dense, buttery, soft cookies that are the best in all the land. These should stay soft for many days if kept in an airtight container.

While it might make sense in a recipe where the butter simply adds a bit of smoothness to the recipe (pancakes, for example), but not where butter is the MAIN INGREDIENT. You need to qualities of butter which are, among other things, semisolid at room temperature. Try coconut oil for a healthier alternative to butter when making cookies. But keep in mind that coconut oil becomes liquid at around 70 degrees F, so those cookies might actually have a better texture when served cold. \\n \\n\\n12/29/15 @ 4:22 pm\\n\\n\\nReply'),\n",

However, coconut oil is high in natural saturated fats. Saturated fats not only increase the healthy cholesterol (known as HDL) in your body, but also help to convert the LDL “bad” cholesterol into good cholesterols. By Increasing the HDL’s in the body, it helps promote heart health, and lower the risk of heart disease. \\nSo…I don’t know what you are talking about. You sound uninformed to me. \\nAlso, I love butter. There’s nothing wrong with using either option it just comes down to what you want, how you feel, what you have available etc. I didn’t have eggs available and I had just enough apple sauce to make the recipe work so it’s technically vegan- I didn’t plan that out on purpose. I’m just too lazy to go to the grocery store today. Apple sauce has some good stuff about it and so does eggs. I’m not sure it really freaking matters which is healthier. \\nTHESE ARE COOKIES, MAH FRANDS!\\n\\n\\n\\n03/12/17 @ 8:41 pm\\n\\n\\nReply'),\n",

For light brown sugar combine 1 c. white granulated sugar and 1 T. Molasses.  for dark brown sugar combine 1 c. white granulated sugar and 2 T. molasses.  For this recipe, add 3/4 c. white granulated sugar and about 1 t. molasses, and you’ll have what the recipe calls for.  No need to combine them, just add as 2 separate ingredients.  I never buy brown sugar, but make it as I need it.\\n\\n\\n\\n05/26/19 @ 6:34 pm\\n\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nKimberly Cox \\nI just made these today  for my son who asked for soft CCC.\\nMy butter wasn’t runny so I beat sugars till creamy.

Yes, you can double the recipe.

They live in all the world\\'s oceans, in freshwater, and on land. They are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton. They generally have five pairs of legs, and they have pincer claws on the ends of the frontmost pair. They first appeared during the Jurassic period, around 200 mill'"
