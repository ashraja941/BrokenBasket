They're fudgy, moist, and super chocolaty, with perfect crispy edges. From Weeknight Baking by Michelle Lopez.Equipment8x8 Baking Dish (this is the one I use so they don't overcook)Cooking Spray (I love this avocado oil one from Chosen Foods)Parchment Paper (this makes it so much easier to remove the brownies from the pan)Ingredients1 1/2 cups granulated sugar*3/4 cup all-purpose flour2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy1/2 cup dark chocolate chips3/4 teaspoons sea salt2 large eggs1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil**2 tablespoons water1/2 teaspoon vanillaInstructionsPreheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!Notes*If you'd like to reduce the sugar, I've had success with 1 cup granulated sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups.\\n**I like to use olive oil because it's what I keep on hand and I enjoy the pairing of olive oil with chocolate. Keep in mind that you will taste it here. For a more neutral flavor, use canola oil.\\n***When these brownies come out of the oven, they'll be super gooey in the middle. Allow them to cool completely, about 2 hours, before you slice into them to give them a chance to set up. They'll continue to firm up the longer they're out of the oven. If you still prefer a firmer brownie, store them in the fridge.Find it online at https://www.loveandlemons.com/brownies-recipe/\"),\n",

I decided to make a buttercream frosting with very subtle strawberry flavor and both the frosting and cake compliment each other very well.

No chilling required. Just ultra thick, soft, classic chocolate chip cookies!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIngredients\\n\\n\\n\\nUnits\\nUSM \\n\\nScale\\n1/2x1x2x \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8 tablespoons of salted butter\\n1/2 cup white sugar (I like to use raw cane sugar with a coarser texture)\\n1/4 cup packed light brown sugar\\n1 teaspoon vanilla\\n1 egg\\n1 1/2 cups all purpose flour (6.75 ounces)\\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\\n1/4 teaspoon salt (but I always add a little extra)\\n3/4 cup chocolate chips (I use a combination of chocolate chips and chocolate chunks)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCook Mode\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPrevent your screen from going dark\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstructions\\n\\n\\n\\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds to just barely melt it. It shouldn’t be hot – but it should be almost entirely in liquid form.\\nUsing a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars until creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just incorporated – 10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the egg for too long, the cookies will be stiff).\\nAdd the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your hands to press the crumbles together into a dough. It should form one large ball that is easy to handle (right at the stage between “wet” dough and “dry” dough). Add the chocolate chips and incorporate with your hands.\\nRoll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies) and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and just barely golden. Warning, friends: DO NOT OVERBAKE. This advice is probably written on every cookie recipe everywhere, but this is essential for keeping the cookies soft. Take them out even if they look like they’re not done yet (see picture in the post). They’ll be pale and puffy.\\nLet them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so (I mean, okay, eat four or five but then let the rest of them cool). They will sink down and turn into these dense, buttery, soft cookies that are the best in all the land. These should stay soft for many days if kept in an airtight container. I also like to freeze them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEquipment\\n\\nSpatula\\nBuy Now → \\n\\nNonstick Sheet Pan\\nBuy Now → \\n\\nMixing Bowl\\nBuy Now → \\nThe equipment section may contain affiliate links to products we know and love. \\n\\n\\nPrep Time: 10 minsCook Time: 10 minsCategory: DessertMethod: BakeCuisine: American')]\n",
